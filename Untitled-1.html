    <h2>Switzerland</h2>
    <p>Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a country situated at the confluence of Western, Central, and
        Southern Europe.[12][note 4] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in
        Bern.[1][2][note 1] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west,
        Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. It is geographically divided among the Swiss
        Plateau, the Alps, and the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi), and land area of 39,997 km2
        (15,443 sq mi). While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately
        8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located,
        among them Zürich, Geneva and Basel, where multiple international organisations are domiciled (such as FIFA, the
        UN's second-largest Office, and the Bank for International Settlements) and where the main international
        airports of Switzerland are.</p>
